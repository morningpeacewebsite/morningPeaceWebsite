              Let's face it—life insurance isn't usually top-of-mind when thinking about what to gift your 
              children or grandchildren. But with the world forever changed by recent global events, including 
              the COVID-19 pandemic, many families are reassessing what it means to provide financial 
              security across generations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Whether you're a parent thinking ahead or a grandparent looking to leave a legacy, one tool 
              stands out: Indexed Universal Life insurance (IUL). It's more than just a policy, it's a smart, 
              flexible strategy to help the next generation build wealth, establish insurability, and create future 
              financial independence.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Here's how starting an IUL early for a child or grandchild can transform into one of the most 
              powerful financial decisions you make for them:
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Benefit 1 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2faeed] mb-4">1. Early Insurability = Lifelong Protection</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Health is unpredictable, and securing insurability early ensures your child or grandchild has 
              protection regardless of what happens later in life. By locking in coverage while they're young 
              and healthy, you're giving them a foundation of financial security that lasts a lifetime—including 
              a death benefit that protects their future family.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Benefit 2 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2faeed] mb-4">2. Lower Costs + Greater Growth Potential</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Buying life insurance at a younger age generally means much lower cost of insurance (COI). 
              These savings boost the policy's cash value potential over time. When paired with an indexed 
              strategy, the IUL policy provides growth tied to a market index—without the risk of market 
              losses. With time on their side, the accumulation potential is significantly higher than if the same 
              policy were started in adulthood.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Benefit 3 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2faeed] mb-4">3. Affordable to Start – Flexible to Grow</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              IULs are flexible by design. Parents or grandparents can start with small monthly 
              contributions—as little as $30, $45, or $60/month—and let the policy grow over time. Once the 
              child reaches adulthood (often around age 22), ownership and responsibility can transfer to them. 
              From there, they can increase contributions as their income grows, maximizing the policy's long-
              term value.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Benefit 4 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2faeed] mb-4">4. Tax-Advantaged Retirement Income</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              When properly structured, an IUL can provide tax-free supplemental retirement income 
              through policy loans and withdrawals. Since contributions are made with after-tax dollars, there 
              are no income taxes on gains when accessed properly offering a hedge against rising future tax 
              rates. This turns the policy into a long-term savings tool, not just an insurance product.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Benefit 5 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2faeed] mb-4">5. Access to Living Benefits</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Most modern IULs include Living Benefit Riders, allowing the policyholder to access funds in 
              case of terminal, critical, or chronic illness. This can help cover unexpected healthcare costs 
              without dipping into other savings or retirement assets.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Benefit 6 */}
          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#2faeed] mb-4">6. The Gift of Daily Impact</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Think about it this way:</p>
            <ul className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
              <li>$1 a day = $30/month</li>
              <li>$1.50 a day = $45/month</li>
              <li>$2 a day = $60/month</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              These small daily amounts can jumpstart a lifetime of financial security for your child or 
              grandchild. When reframed as a simple daily habit, building a future for your loved one becomes 
              both manageable and meaningful.
